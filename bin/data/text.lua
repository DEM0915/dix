   Tian'anmen square.  It was from Tian'anmen Square 

   in China,  where students my age — your age — had gathered 

   to ask their government to grant them fundamental freedoms

   on this day,  troops loyal to the Government on the 

   students gather in Tian'anmen Square to use military
 
   weapons,  causing casualties cannot be calculated .﻿
